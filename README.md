It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
TensorFlow has gained immense popularity over the past few months, owing to its power and ease of use. This video aims to help you leverage the power of TensorFlow to do image processing. Beginning with an introduction to image processing, the video will take you through TensorFlow's API-like graph tensor, which is generally used for image classification.

Starting off with basic 2D images, the video will gradually take you through recognizing more complex images, colors, shapes, and so on. Making use of the Python API, you will move on to classifying and training your model to identify objects in an image.

Then you will learn about Convolutional Neural Networks, its architecture and why they perform well in the image takes. You will dive into the different layers available in TensorFlow. Further, we will construct the neural network feature extractor to embed images into a dense and rich vector space and finally perform fine-tuning optimization using pre-trained neural networks.
